    <ExternalLink href="https://gitmoji.dev/">Gitmoji</ExternalLink> is a powerful tool to enhance documentation
    by developers via thoughtful commit messages. With <ExternalLink
      href="https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli#gitmoji-cli">gitmoji-cli</ExternalLink
    > you can use it directly from the command line. It makes you choose an emoji to match your commit.
    After that, you are prompted to enter the message itself.
  </p>

  <pre><samp
      >$ <kbd>gitmoji -c</kbd>
? Choose a gitmoji: (Use arrow keys or type to search)
‚ùØ üé®  - Improve structure / format of the code.
  ‚ö°Ô∏è  - Improve performance.
  üî•  - Remove code or files.
  üêõ  - Fix a bug.
  üöëÔ∏è  - Critical hotfix.
  ‚ú®  - Introduce new features.
  üìù  - Add or update documentation.

    Another tool I really like is <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit"
      >lazygit</ExternalLink
    >. It offers the power of the command line while working in a appealing UI. The git integrations
    of Visual Studio Code and Intellij are nice but feel bloated to me. They abstract the concepts
    of git in a way that fundamental ideas like stashes are lost. Also, users begin to search for
    options with the mouse a lot in these UIs. Knowing basic commands is essential to efficiently
    use git. lazygit can easily navigated with the keyboard and commits actions with the stroke of a
    single key.
    <i>And I'm using neovim btw</i>.

    Using both tools together is easy. You just need to add a custom command to your lazygit
    configuration. you can open the config file by pressing <code>o</code> on the top left status panel.
    Then add the following to your config file:
  </p>

  <pre><samp
      >customCommands:
  - key: 'G'
    command: 'gitmoji -c'
    context: 'files'
    subprocess: yes
    description: 'Commit with gitmoji'
    stream: yes
    showOutput: yes
</samp></pre>
  <p>Now you can invoke gitmoji-cli by pressing <code>G</code> on the files panel ü•≥</p>

    <li>
      You could also use gitmoji-cli as a git commit hook by initialializing with <code
        >gitmoji -i</code
      >.
    </li>
    <li>
      The lazygit config is documented <ExternalLink
        href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Config.md"
        >here</ExternalLink
      >.

      gitmoji is good as it encourages developers to make small commits that are logically sane and
      tightly scoped. I experienced a lot of commits like 'code review changes', 'build frontend
      component' etc. Commit messages like these do not document the work well. Writing a short
      conclusion about your commit as a message helps other developers a lot. gitmoji helps writing
      commit messages as its emojis are grouped into different categories and a commit can only
      belong to one category.
